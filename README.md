## WIP Next Up ##
- Hidden Transformations like importing XMLs from a string column, assumptions
on the length of strings, uniqueness of "ids"
- Testing & Assumptions. Where do we test assumptions? Close to the source.
After that we do not test for "uniqueness" but rather our transformation logic...
(Or do we? Kinda yes, because of assumptions...) We may combine both, but
not 1 without the other! (So uniqueness on front model is fine, if 
  I have uniqueness in source!)
